#Repostiory#

A repositroy contains all the projects files (images, docs, videos, etc) as well as the history of all the files' versions. Repositories allow collaboration without limitation. Users can create a repository, and can control what collaborators get to update by managing pull/push requests. In GitHub, repositories also act as a place to organize tasks, collect issues, keep changes and updates categorized, and generally control devolpment. In the photo below is the repository for [this](/sehrishsaeed/miniproject1-ss-ye) project. The first thing shown is the [README](/README.md) file, and the baisc file structure.
