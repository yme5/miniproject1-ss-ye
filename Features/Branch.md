# Branch

Branching is a copy of the repository that is dependent on its original, ie, deleting the original deletes the branch, but modifiying the original does not change the branch. This allows the users to develop new features independently, and then merge when theyre done. Branching is critical for agile devolpment, and is understanding branching is the first step to GitFLow.
