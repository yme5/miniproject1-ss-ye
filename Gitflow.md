GitFlow is a model for how to conduct pranching when creating a product. It is designed so teams can develop different features simultaneously, while keeping the code base organized. 

## How does it work?
The user begins by creating a 5+ branches;
1.  The main branch is the branch inteneded for released code only. This is the product the customer sees 
2.  The Develop branch is where features are pulled from. 
3.  The Feature branch is where feaures are made
4.  The Release bracnh where the features are tested in unison. 
5.  The hotfixes branch is where the emergency bugs are fixed
